        <h1>8.	Clean Code/ Refactoring</h1>
        <p> Remember the times that one of your parents order you to clean up your room? 
        And probably you think at those moments: Stop nagging, let me just continue playing. 
        Until at a certain moment when you want to play with your toy dinosaur and you cannot find it anywhere.
        </p>

        <p>Than you realize that perhaps your parents had a valid point when they asked you to clean up your mess.
        When a nicely cleaned up room you would have found your dinosaur in a second. 
        
        That is what is meant with clean code. If you organize your code in a nice manner it is easier to find 
        certain pieces of code back. Especially if you want other people to have a look at your code as well. 
        Imagine what would happen if you ask someone else to look in your mess to your toy dinosaur!

        <h3>Refactoring</h3>    
    
        </p> Refactoring means that you try to keep the lines of code as short and simple as possible. 
            This way your code is easier to read, not only for yourself but for others also.

        <h1>9.	Clean Code/ DRY, KISS and Separation of concerns</h1>
        <p> 
            <span class="bigger">DRY</span>, what does it mean? Exept for the fact that it doesn't rain ... It is an acronym 
            for Don't Repeat Yourself. Even though this sounds very logical it does happen easily 
            when youre code is getting more and more extended and complex. It happens a lot that
            at some point you have created a piece of code twice for the same purpose. It is not 
            hard to imagine that this complicates your code and an important part of clean code is 
            to avoid this.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img id="kiss" src="images/kiss.png">
            <span class="bigger">KISS</span>, stands for Keep It Simple, Stupid. It means that you have to look
            for the most simple way of coding your method. There are often many ways of reaching the same goal and 
            KISS is simply a way for you to choose the most simple way so your code maintains its readability.
    
            In Summary, clean code means that you keep your code organized and as simple as possible. In the end,
            who doesn't like a clean and tidy room :)
